# TypeScript - VueJS - NodeJS Starter Template

I made this template to create a starting point when developing apps that expose a NodeJS Backend with a VueJS Frontend, including HMR (Hot Module Reload) and Webpack bundling in the server. The starting code is as similar as the one given by ```vue create```. The development server also features automatic reloading of the server code using Nodemon.

It includes the following options enabled for Vue: TypeScript, Babel, Webpack, Jest, and PWA.

## Project setup (only needed for the first time)
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development (both for the Frontend and the Backend)
```
npm run dev
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Start the server with production code
```
npx cross-env NODE_ENV=production npm run start
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
